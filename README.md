# Bootcamp 01 Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

This is a summary of what I did for the week 1 challenge. I was given an existing starter code that could use some cleanup and simplifying of both the HTML and CSS. This was to be accomplished without changing what it does. Part of the project is to upload it to Git Hub in a unique repository and publish it.

## What I implemented

I changed the title element to display: "Horiseon Consulting"

I changed HTML elements from standard div tags to appropriate names to help with reading the code.

I made sure all links were functioning properly.

I removed needless classes.

I consolidated CSS with identical properties and organized CSS elements to read more efficiently.
